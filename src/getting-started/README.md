# Getting Started

Welcome to your C++ programming journey! This section will help you set up your development environment and write your first C++ program.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll discover:

- *How to install* a C++ compiler and development tools
- *Your first C++ program* - the classic "Hello, World!"
- *Basic project structure* and compilation process
- *Essential development workflow* for C++ programming

## Why C++?

C++ is a powerful programming language that gives you:

- <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i> *High Performance*: Direct hardware access and efficient execution
- <i class="fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> *System Control*: Manual memory management and low-level operations  
- <i class="fa-solid fa-bolt"></i> *Scalability*: From small utilities to large-scale applications
- <i class="fa-solid fa-earth-americas"></i> *Versatility*: Desktop apps, games, embedded systems, and more
- <i class="fa-solid fa-book"></i> *Rich Ecosystem*: Extensive libraries and active community

## Development Workflow

A typical C++ development process looks like this:

1. *Write* your code in .cpp and .h files
2. *Compile* source code into object files
3. *Link* object files into an executable
4. *Run* and test your program
5. *Debug* and refine as needed

Let's get your environment ready and write some code!
